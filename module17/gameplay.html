          <img alt="TF2" src="assets/TF2.jpg">
          <figcaption>Team Fortress 2 Logo</figcaption>
        </figure>
    
        <p><b>Team Fortress 2:</b> An online FPS with 9 distinct classes for a variety of gameplay options. 
        This game has a cartoony artstyle and features an insane amount of hats to wear. It's basically
        a war themed hat simulator. The 9 classes come from different places around the world and each
        has their own unique and quirky personality traits which translates into a charming and hilarious 
        experience. And yet, still the core gameplay is worthy of being under the title of timeless masterpiece. TF2
        is mostly known by its iconic Rocket Jump feature. The Soldier is a class in Team Fortess 2 who uses a
        rocket launcher as his primary weapon. Aiming at the ground and shooting after a well-timed jump will allow 
        the soldier to blast jump very far distances both vertically and horizontally at the cost of some health. This gameplay mechanic creates 
        variety a of high-level exchanges with enemy combatants and opens up a large skill ceiling for long-time players.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p><b>Xenoblade Chronicles:</b> An epic JRPG spanning across the backs of two massive titans. The story has
        some crazy twists that had my mind struggling to come to terms with what just occured. The gameplay 
        contains a unique hybrid of real-time action and turn based combat which requires key positioning in order to get 
        the most out of certain attacks. For example, the Back Slash attack does 100% more damage when hitting an enemy from behind.
        It is impossible to not love the characters and their charming British banter. The music
        is simply divine and the sense of scale felt by the wonder of discovering bizarre lands on such a gigantic beast is truly
        magnificent to behold.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p><b>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask:</b> A legendary Action Adventure game following the tale of a young boy named Link
        who must save the land before a possessed Moon is able to crash into the ground in 3 days time. This game features a time
        travel mechanic which allows the player to go back in time as many times as needed in order to prevent the
        disaster that looms overhead. But when time is turned back, progress for many actions in the world and story reset while key items are retained. 
        The world and characters around Link are affected by the time of day, and thus the player
        can manipulate time to create certain outcomes in their favor. Combat revolves around the use of a sword and shield alongside a 
        surplus of support items such as a bow and arrow, bombs, and a hookshot. A big aspect of this game are the different masks
        which can be obtained as the player progresses. Each mask has a unique effect on Link ranging from total transformations to 
        invisibility against enemies.</p>

          <figcaption>Dark Souls 3 Screenshot</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p><b>Dark Souls 3:</b> Part of what is widely considered one of the most difficult video game franchises of all time, Dark Souls
        3 is the most advanced and exciting of the 3 games. The game takes place in a midieval Lovecraftian-esque setting where the world has been desolated
        by the undead. As a hollow yourself, you continue to ressurect after each death and seek to reignite your being with the embers of fire. The darkness 
        and isolation felt while playing this gruesome and difficult game focused on visceral and thrilling combat is quite overwhelming. This game will have you die over and over 
        and it won't pull punches. One of the biggest parts of this game are the epic boss battles that will leave you blown away by the bombastic orchestrated music and brutal fights to be had.</p>

          <figcaption>Super Smash Brothers Screenshot</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p><b>Super Smash Brothers:</b> This entry isn't particularly one game, but the whole series. Nothing in this world brings me more hype than Super Smash Brothers. The appeal of 
        this fighting game is definitely the huge roster of iconic video game characters which spans a massive lineage of popular and cult classics across the ages of time. There's something 
        strangely enticing about Pac-Man beating Mario to the ground. New character reveals and speculation for said characters is one of the most fun things to think about while waiting for each
        new game in the series. There's actually a new one coming out for the Nintendo Switch this year, and E3 is going to be revealing it for the first time ever. Thinking about these games 
        can seriously burn me out because of the insane amounts of hype it generates. Smash Brothers is different from any other fighter game out there because it requires you to damage the opponent enough to knock
        them off the stage in order to take a life from them. Instead of HP (Hit Point/Health Point) bars, the characters rack up damage based on percentage values. The higher the value,
        the farther they get launched when taking damage.</p>

        <p><b>Valve</b>: The creators of the highly acclaimed Half-Life series, the Portal series,
        Team Fortress 2, the Counter-Strike series, the Dota series, and the Left4Dead series. I will always love Valve for creating my favorite online game of all time, but I can't help but feel they have fallen out of line
        for the past several years. They unfortunately don't seem too interested in making games anymore due to their success with the Steam platform on PC. I do hope they change soon
        but I will never forget the great developers they once were if they do not get back on track.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p><b>Nintendo</b>: A giant Japanese company that single handedly saved the entire gaming industry from a market crash that occured in 1983. They are the legends behind the most iconic franchises 
        in gaming such as Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Pokemon, and Donkey Kong. Most of my favorite games are made by Nintendo.</p>

        <p><b>MonolithSoft</b>: The creators of the Xenoblade series which is currently my favorite series of all time. Their most recent game was a bit of a letdown, but I still love
        them despite that. I believe they can continue to make good games as time goes on. MonolithSoft is now actually a subdivision of Nintendo.</p>

        <p><b>FromSoftware</b>: The harbringers of hell itself in video game form, the Dark Souls series. The people at FromSoft definitely know what they're doing. They have gotten better
        at game design with each game and their magnum opus of brilliant combat and level design is available right now - Dark Souls 3. I tend to get a laugh out of telling people about FromSoft's games since
        I always say "this game is <i>from</i> <i>From</i> Software."</p>

        <p><b>Atlus</b>: Because of the Persona series I have recently begun to love the people over at Atlus. There isn't really anything quite like it in gaming. Although Persona is a very niche franchise due to
        the heavy amount of Japanese culture, I found myself loving it from the start.</p>

    <h2>Games at their Core</h2>
    
    <p>Surely, storytelling has been heavily innovated on due to the interactive elements
    that video games have introduced to the entertainment industry. Controlling a character
    within a game can make you feel immersed in an unknown world like never before. But 
    storytelling is not all that video games have to offer. The main meat of entertainment 
    that can be found within the world of video games is the fun aspect of simply playing them.
    Gameplay is a huge part of what makes a game, well, a game. And the evolution of that 
    gameplay has been staggering over the past few decades compared to what the oldest games 
    used to be like back when Pong was considered new to people.</p>
    
    <p>There are many gameplay mechanics that create fun and exciting play sessions for people of all ages to enjoy.
    Video games have limitless potential since they are not bound by the physical limitations of our world.
    It is up to the developers to use their creative vision in order to make a special and entertaining video game.
    If you can think of it, it's probably possible in a video game.</p>
    
    <p>A big part of what makes a video game feel good to play is the frame rate. The ideal frame rate is a solid 60FPS (frames per second)
    since this displays 60 frames on a screen per second. Games at 60FPS look fluid and deliver a more enjoyable gameplay experience.
    Some old games ran at pretty low frame rates around the 20FPS mark, and going back to play them today kind of hurts. It is a bit hard to play a game with 20FPS since 
    it is noticably choppier than a game running at 60FPS. While a solid 60FPS is ideal, a solid 30FPS looks great too. It is more important that a games keeps a 
    consistent frame rate than a high one. If a video game has an unstable frame rate, then the visuals on the screen will feel laggy and can easily rip people away from the experience.</p>
    
    <p>Many games are focused on combat, or at least have some sort of combat element. Often a game will pit the player
    against enemy AI (Artificial Intelligence) of increasing difficulty as the game progresses. Being able to combo enemies 
    into several different moves for devastating finishers is one of the most satisfying things when the combat feels fluid and
    engaging. Upgrade systems that improve your character's ability in battle make for a very rewarding feeling of progression.
    Feeling like you are becoming more powerful in a game while the enemies are also increasing their potency just feels great.</p>
    
    <p>While many single-player games include AI combatants for the player to compete against, there are also a lot of games that
    utilize the feature of PvP (Player versus Player) gameplay and combat. Video games are fun alone, but it's even better to grab 
    a friend and play a cooperative game which requires teamwork in order to succeed. If teamwork doesn't suit you though, you can always
    have a friendly competition in 1v1 battles. If one on one isn't enough, why not take it online and play against players around the world?</p>
    
    <p>Online games introduce the concept of engaging with people in video game matches over the Internet.
    It's great fun to crush an opponent who you know is actually another player somewhere out there struggling to figure out how to play 
    the game. Finding someone who is on your skill level is also cool because they can provide you a challenge which AI opponents can't. Human players 
    can usually think up many more options to beat you in a game compared to a pre-programmed AI.</p>
    
    <p>Combat is my personal favorite form of gameplay in most games, but there are many other types of gameplay depending on the game 
    you're playing. Some games may have the player solve puzzles and instead have a focus on exploration rather than combat. Another popular type 
    of gameplay is racing. But even if the main goal of a racer is to get to the finish line first, certain games such as <b>Mario Kart</b> by <b>Nintendo</b> include items 
    that allow the racers to grab items and fling them at other racers to hurt their chances of winning. These items make for a chaotic and hectic 
    race that is more exciting than just driving around a course normally.</p>
    
    <p>Another popular form of gameplay involves platforming where the character jumps around to collect certain key items in order to progress 
    to new levels and unlock secret areas. By far the most popular and one of the best 3D platformers ever made is <b>Super Mario 64</b> by <b>Nintendo</b>.</p>
    
    <p>Games that focus on story might give the player a difficult set of choices which can drastically alter what happens to the characters
    and world around them depending on what they do. <b>Telltale's</b> games come to mind when thinking of this type of choice driven interactivity
    is involved. Two of my personal favorites of theirs are <b>Telltale's The Walking Dead</b> and <b>Telltale's The Wolf Among Us</b>. Both of them
    have engaging and atmospheric narratives that fuel the need to find out what happens next.</p>
    
    <h3>The First Video Game</h3>
    
    <p>Entering the first game ever created: <b>Tennis for Two</b>. This game was created
    by William Higinbotham in 1958. <b>Tennis for Two</b> was not too different from the more well-known arcade game
    <b>Pong</b> which was released in 1972. The only objective of <b>Tennis for Two</b> was to hit a ball towards another 
    player's goal to try and score. The controls consisted of a single knob which turned the angle at which 
    the ball would be shot, and a button which shot the ball. As long as a player attempted to hit the ball while it was 
    in their court, it would be hit back towards the other player.</p>
    
    <p>While Higinbotham's video game may seem ridiculously trivial and basic by today's standards, this game was a revolutionary
    concept which had never been thought of until then. William's game did not pick up much
    attention, so he left the project to the wayside. Ironically, the creator of the first video
    game had no idea how big of a deal video games would later become, and he had no
    interest in them despite that. He was a physicist after all, and he only incidentally
    created a video game because he wanted to appeal to people touring his lab by providing them an 
    interactive experience.</p>
    
    <h3>The First Icon in Gaming</h3>
    
    <p>The earliest commercial video games had very little gameplay elements and restricted control options
    due to technological limitations. Computers themselves were rather young at the time
    video games were first being created for them, so not much could be done when designing a
    game with a weak system holding the developers back.</p> 
    
    <p>One of the earliest video games to achieve popularity with people around
    the world was the arcade game <b>Pong</b>, developed by <b>Atari</b>. Although this game was similar to the first game ever made, it
    had more gameplay features that made it a complete video game. For one, it actually kept track of each players' score.
    Players could control a paddle on either side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth as it perpetually moved across
    the court. The paddle could only be moved vertically and depending on the angle the ball was hit at, the ball could be 
    hit diagonally at increased speeds to confuse the other player. The goal of the game was to score 11 points before the
    other player in order to win. <b>Pong</b> was the first commercially successful video game and paved the way for the video game 
    industry as a whole.</p>
