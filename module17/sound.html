    <h3>Favorite OSTs</h3>
    
    <p>Just to give you an idea of what a good OST (Original Soundtrack) sounds like, you can check out the OST for these few games. Taste
    in music may be subjective, but I doubt you will find any of these soundtracks to be less than good. Listening back on all of these fills me with
    a grand feeling of nostalgia. I can't really express how great they are in my own words, so give them a listen.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Video Game Jingles</h3>
    <p>Video Games are well-known for their iconic jingles that play when certain actions are complete such as opening a chest,
    completing a level, or receiving a powerup. Here are some of my favorites across time.</p>
    
    <p>This little tune is as classic as video game sounds get, and it still sounds perfect no matter how many times I listen to it.
    This jingle being combined with the obtaining of a new item in Ocarina of Time makes for a heavenly combination. It is composed by <b>Koji Kondo:</b></p>

    <p>This tune is so cheerful and happy that I almost want to start dancing along to it, haha. It is an amazing piece of music that 
    fits great with reaching the end of a stage in the Kirby games. It is composed by <b>Hirokazu Ando, Jun Ishikawa, and Yuuta Ogasawara:</b></p>

    <p>The Super Mario Bros. coin sound effect is extremely iconic. Picking up coins is already satisfying as it is, but with this added
    jingle I simply can't resist trying to collect as many as possible. It is composed by <b>Koji Kondo:</b></p>

    <p>Catching Pokemon is the main objective of Pokemon games, and this jingle keeps me coming back to catch more of them just to hear it again.
    It is composed by <b>Go Ichinos and Junichi Masuda:</b></p>

    <h2>The Music of Video Games</h2>
    <p>While video games are notorious for being fun to play, music and sound in video games
    is a very important aspect of the medium. A game with great gameplay can be hurt by a weak
    soundtrack. A great soundtrack has a huge effect on a player's experience with a game. A powerful
    score is the best way to have people remember a game for a long time, even beyond its initial life.
    To stand the test of time and be revered as one of the greats, a video game must include good music and sound design.</p>
    
    <p>There is something extremely enriching about video game music, I can't help but love it. Almost all of my favorite
    songs actually come from video games, not record labels or popular singers and the like. Good video game music is very easy
    to memorize and that then allows me to become familiar with a game in a way that makes me feel at peace. Whenever I work I almost
    always put on some video game music to help me relax and focus. There are little things in this world that are better than the nostalgic tunes of a game
    I fell in love with during my childhood.</p>
    
    <p>And although a good soundtrack helps to create a much better video game experience in of itself, it is
    important to not forget about Sound Design. While controlling a character it is vital that the character's
    footsteps have sound to them, and the area you are in within the game must translate to different frequencies of 
    sound. For example, when you control a character underwater the sound should become muffled as it would in real life.
    If the player is in a cave, it would make sense for the cave to add an echo effect to certain audio cues. 
    This logical method of designing sound around a player's activity creates a more interesting and dynamic experience, even
    if it may be subtle towards the player.</p>
