    <h3>Games with no Graphics</h3>
    <p> There aren't many video games that don't have graphics at all, but they do exist. These games are considered text-based
    because they only have lines of text and rely completely on story and the player's imagination. Most of the games like this were
    made in the 1970s-1980s to run on extremely weak computers. These games were pretty restrictive in regards to what the player could
    do within the game because only a certain set of two word command lines would progress the current scenario. However, that changed after a monumental
    new game was released in the genre... ZORK.</p>

    <p>Zork was not your run of the mill text-based game, in fact it was state of the art. This new game could take full sentence command lines
    instead of only simple two word commands. Any scenario could be tackled in almost limitless ways. Zork's dynamic nature was a huge step forward
    for video games, and it opened up new world building possibilities for gaming. Zork paved the way for complex levels of storytelling in video games since
    each and ever player could have a vastly different experience while playing the game. Decisions had weight to them and actually opened up new paths depending on
    what the player did.</p>

    <h3>VR (Virtual Reality)</h3>
    <p>Virtual Reality is the concept of putting the player inside the game, immersing them within the video game world as if they were truly there
    in real life. VR is an extremely revolutionary and innovative idea for gaming as a whole and paves the way for all sorts of new applications for gaming,
    but right now VR is in its very early infancy. VR and the technology for VR is nowhere near the level it needs to be in order to give players a good experience.
    The current VR games offer little to do and actually restrict the player.</p>

    <p>VR requires you to put on a large headset that weighs you down and feels rather uncomfortable. Virtual Reality games make you turn around and move to move in 
    the game, but this is a problem since most people don't have a properly sized space adequate for VR use. You need an extremely expensive and powerful PC in order to 
    use VR software in the first place, and you must be tethered to your PC at all times. There are other wireless alternatives and currently more are being made, but 
    the market is still so young that there aren't many options available yet. 
    
    <p>I have only used a VR headset for about 5 minutes, and while it was pretty cool, I don't think the current VR headset prices are at all worth buying into. The cheapest you will find a 
    low end VR headset for is about $200, and the better ones are borderline $1,000. You'd be better off investing in a high-end gaming computer at that point. These asking prices are absolutely insane for a short, demo gaming experience that might last an hour at most.
    In my opinion, VR games aren't enticing enough to warrant the price of the accessories required to use them just yet. It'd be best to wait until the technology advances.</p>

    <h2>Games as an Artform</h2>
    <p>There are many great things about video games, and graphics are definitely up there on the greatness scale.
    The graphical fidelity of a game can enhance the experience and draw a player in to the point where they might not be able to 
    tell the difference between the game and real life. Not all games go for a realistic visual style though, and I honestly prefer 
    games that go for more stylistic graphics that stray away from realism.</p>
    
    <p>In my opinion, video games should not try to emulate real life too much. While there are certain aspects of real life that
    make sense to include in a game in order to leave the player understanding of the game, I never want a game to completely simulate
    real life. I find that games have so much more to offer in the visual department that simply choosing a realistic stlye of graphics is almost
    taking the easy way out at this point.</p>
    
    <p>Now that my silly rant is over, let's get into games as an artform. Video games started out with very simple 2D visuals that consisted of
    a small amount of pixels lined up in different patters in order to create shapes and objects. These early pixel games were considered "8-bit" and were 
    only able to make use of 256 colors. Some old games utilizing these 8-bit graphics are <b>Super Mario Bros.</b> by <b>Nintendo</b>, <b>Mega Man</b> by <b>Capcom</b>, 
    and <b>Castlevania</b> by <b>Konami</b>.</p>

    <p>Further yet, games eventually hit the "16-bit" era which allowed developers to use even more pixels than before and 
    effectively led to developers having less limitations on what they were able to depict with graphics in their games.</p>

    <p>Eventually 3D graphics were introduced to gaming and the medium was changed forever. Not only did games now have a whole new dimension for gamers to play around in, but the graphical capabilities
    were improved by a whole generation. The early 3D games were pretty rough around the edges but as developers learned how to create better 3D graphics, games quickly
    evolved from a simple 2D graphical artform into a full 3D, and later still, HD artform. Video games were no longer only fun to play, but could genuinely look 
    stunningly beautiful.</p>

    <p>While games today are still made up of pixels at the end of the day, there are many more complicated processes that create powerful imagery such as 
    3D polygonal modeling. The graphically demanding games of today consist of thousands of pixels. Graphics are nice and all, but what really gets me interested in a game's visuals has to be a unique
    and stylistic art style. One of the most stylistically impressive games I've seen is <b>Persona 5</b> by <b>Atlus</b>. That game simply oozes style from the menus to the characters
    and everything inbetween.</p>
