    <h2>Why I chose this Topic</h2>
    
    <p>I have loved video games ever since I was 2 years old. The earliest games I
    have fond memories of are from Nintendo, and I still love their games to this day.
    I wouldn't be who I am today without games bringing me and my best friend closer together.
    I have video games to thank for the majority of fun in my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
    As you can tell, the level of passion I hold for this form of entertainment is unparalleled.</p>
    
    <p>I am an aspiring game developer despite having little knowledge on the subject of coding video games. It's more-so a goal of mine to work 
    towards at the moment. I think that learning in a coding environment with HTML/CSS is a nice first step towards reaching that goal while 
    obtaining the needed pre-prerequisites in order to take a programming class at the JC.</p>
    
    <p>It was really fun to build this website, I am glad I got to choose a topic that interests me so much. That definitely made the workload a lot
    less painful.</p>
