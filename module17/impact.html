    <h3>eSports</h3>
    <p> It's always fun to sit down and relax while enjoying a casual video game, but competitive gaming is 
    a perfectly valid way of playing video games as well. The professional competitive video game scene has a special name: eSports.
    eSports stands for Electronic Sports among many other terms. eSports is a rapidly growing industry that hosts live tournaments which
    are streamed online featuring the best players from all around the world competing against each other.</p>

     <p>eSports viewing is on track to outpace regular professional Sports viewing which is extremely impressive. Competitive video gaming is
    honestly very fun to watch. Seeing how players interact with their opponents to get the upper hand and defeat them with glorious teamwork
    has to be one of the most exciting events viewable online.</p>
    
    <p>Even if you aren't particularly interested in video games, watching eSports might
    catch your interest. Watching video games played at a professional level can be surprisingly entertaining. There is a lot of hype in the eSports
    community and that comes from the very nature of gamers at heart. We want to be excited. We want to live in the moment. We love to hype matches up
    by cheering for our favorite players. It isn't too different from normal sports when you think about it, it's still a competition but with video games 
    instead of real life ball play.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, eSports have many categories to offer including 1-on-1s and team battles. There are also tons of genres to choose from when picking a competitive
    video game match to watch, so that already offers a lot more variety in competition compared to normal sports where the amount of competitive real life 
    sports to choose from are miniscule in comparison.</p>

    <h3>Conventions</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of video game conventions where gamers of all types gather together to share their love for video games.
    However, there is one absolutely massive video game convention that trumps all others, and that convention is known as none other than
    E3 itself. E3 stands for Electronic Entertainment Expo. At E3 all of the biggest game developers and publishers from around the world come to show off their biggest
    and latest projects kept secret soley for the announcement at the E3.</p>
    
    <figure>
        <img alt="e3" src="assets/e3_2015.jpg">
        <figcaption>E3 2015</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>The first E3 was held in 1995. E3 occurs once a year, every year around early June in Los Angeles, California at the Convention Center. Yes, that means E3 is coming up in just under a month, and I am pumped for it! 
    E3 is a cultural mainstay for video games and I hope it never stops having events. There are always some huge announcements from beloved game developers
    that gets my blood flowing. This event gives off a certain aura that fuels me with excitement. E3 is basically a video game Christmans, the scale of the event
    is positively huge. Big gaming corporations don't hold back when it comes to E3. There are tons of new reveals and I can't get enough of it.</p>
    
    <p>Each of the "Big 3" hold either a large scale press conference or a high production video revealing new games. The "Big 3" gaming giants are known as Nintendo,
    Sony, and Microsoft. There are other events held within E3 by smaller companies, but they don't gain the levels of traction and hype that the Big 3 manage to pull in each year.
    People like to predict which of the 3 will have the best showing at E3 as a little game in of itself. I tend to be on team Nintendo (at this point I'm sure my Nintendo bias
    is shining through the screen) but I am always excited to see what every company has to show us at E3. </p>

    <h2>Games as a Product</h2>
    
    <p>The video game industry is growing rapidly and continues to create a healthy
    economic environment as time goes on. The graphic below displays estimates for a steady growth
    of sales for video games on all platforms from 2016-2020.</p>

    </figure>
    
    <p>Video Games naturally bring in a considerable amount of money for the developers 
    that create them, if they succeed. The current MSRP for new big budget games is $60, but smaller budget titles might sell
    for $20, or even less upon release. Video Games are very expensive to make, so it is important that a game being sold for profit 
    makes strong sales in order for a developer studio to continue working on more projects. There are many cases where game developer 
    studios have to shutdown entirely because some of their games end up failing.</p>
    
    <p>The average cost for creating a video game back in 1996 was just short of $1 million,
    but certain games in the past decade have put companies into the hundred million dollar range.
    For example, <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> had a staggering $265 million budget! Of course, the scope
    and size of a game can fluctuate the cost of a game dramatically. The cost depends on things like
    whether or not the game utilizes 3D graphics or 2D graphics, voice acting, and complex gameplay
    mechanics. A video game that has a simple 2D artstyle would cost a lot less to make due to there
    being less effort required to complete a smaller project.</p>
    
    <p>The table below shows some of the best selling
    games of all time...</p>
