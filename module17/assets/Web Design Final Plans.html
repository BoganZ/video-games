    <p>I am planning to do a website on video games for my final project. 
    
I have always loved them since I was but 2 years old so I feel it 

is the perfect topic for me to make a site on. I will probably 

include specifics such as video games and developers I love, some of the first 

games ever made, some of the best selling video games, and 

just general history on video games alongside the revolutionary 

concepts they have introduced to the entertainment industry. 

The progression of graphics, gameplay evolution, 

and soundtrack implementation are all things I will probably 

include as well.</p>
